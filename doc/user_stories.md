# As a user ...

## ... I want the optimizer to take my OS into consideration

Different operating systems have different key combinations, and my ergonomic layout should allow me to not only type but also work ergonomically.


## ... I want the optimizer to look into code I am writing

Different programming languages use certain special characters more than others, and my ergonomic keyboard layout should allow me to get the most ergonomic experience when programming.

## ... I want the optimizer to generate firmware files

As a user of a reprogrammable keyboard I want the optimizer to output config I can use with it.

## ... I want the optimizer to be aware of my keyboard

Since not everyone is using a standard keyboard with 108 keys, I want the optimizer to adapt new and existing layouts to the constraints of the keyobard I am using.

## ... I want the optimizer to be aware of special firmware features

Depending on the target firmware the optimizer should not only use features like layers, but also hold-taps, tap-dances, combos and other features that help reduce cost per typed key.

## ... I want the optimizer to be aware of nested layer.

When a lot of layers are generated, the optimizer should take alternative layer switching ways into consideration.

## ... I want the optimizer to handle all my keys

Features like rgb control, bluotooth profile switching and such should be handled by the optimizer. Other keys that can't be typed should also be part of that.

## ... I want the program to provide sane defaults

When I start to work with the optimizer I don't want to be overwhelmed.

## ... I want a place to get help easily

I just want to make sure that people don't have a lot of friction when it comes to asking for help.

## .. I want a wizard to guide me trough config options

Instead of using a documentation for the config format I want a wizard to be able to generate a basic config for me.

## ... I want to keep different layout configs

Either for trying out new things or porting a good working config to a new language, the app should handle different config files. 

## ... I want a cli interface to set configuration options

## ... I want to be able to blacklist certain things

If some optimization does not feel good to me I want to blacklist certain characters on certain positions.

## ... I want to provide keys that have to be next to each other

Arrow keys for example should not be taken apart by the optimizer.
